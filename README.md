# github-user-info
An application that displays GitHub user information based on GitHub's API.
This is still in it's development phase and is built as a starter for using React with JSPM.

### Hosting locally
My preference is using serve. Install it using npm [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve).
Navigate to the project location.Then run command: `serve github-user-info`.
